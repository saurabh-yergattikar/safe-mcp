## Tactic
**Discovery (ATK-TA0007)**

## Description
Tool enumeration is a reconnaissance technique where an adversary attempts to identify which tools, services, plugins, connectors, or helper components exist in a target environment—including their versions and configurations. The goal is to understand the capabilities exposed by the environment (e.g., code execution helpers, file access APIs, external connectors) to identify potential follow-on attack opportunities such as misconfigured services, unpatched versions, or weak authentication.  

---

## How It Works

1. **Reconnaissance / Footprinting**  
   - Attacker identifies public or semi-public surfaces: web UIs, chatbot endpoints, API gateways, SDKs, sample clients, developer consoles, or third-party integrations.  
   - Metadata collection via public documentation, SDK examples, API spec URLs, JS bundles, and HTML/JS comments.  

   **Defender indicators:** unusual downloads of API docs or SDK files, access to developer-only pages, requests to manifest-like URLs.  

2. **Fingerprinting & Information Extraction**  
   - Sending requests to elicit informative responses (error messages, version headers, descriptive model outputs).  
   - Crafting queries that reveal tool capabilities (e.g., asking which tools are available).  

   **Defender indicators:** requests producing errors or meta-questions, verbose debug output.  

3. **Active Probing / Capability Testing**  
   - Varying parameters or endpoints to detect accepted tool names and observable responses.  
   - Observing side channels such as timing differences or response sizes.  

   **Defender indicators:** high volume of similar requests, many 4xx/5xx responses, latency anomalies.  

4. **Correlation & Inference**  
   - Aggregating results to build an inventory of tools, capabilities, owners, and trust boundaries.  
   - Combining with external information (open-source repos, leaked configs).  

   **Defender indicators:** multiple endpoints accessed over time, repeated token/credential validation attempts.  

5. **Testing for Privileged Behaviors**  
   - Checking whether invoking a tool causes privileged effects (e.g., storage access, outbound network calls).  
   - Evaluating potential chains of tool interactions.  

   **Defender indicators:** unprivileged users invoking internal-only tools, unusual outbound connections.  

6. **Persistence & Staging**  
   - Using weakly protected interfaces to obtain credentials, pivot, or stage exfiltration.  

   **Defender indicators:** new credentials used from unusual origins, unexpected storage writes, anomalous outbound data.

## Examples
An attacker with a stolen developer API key quietly probes an MCP, enumerates available tools (storage, external fetch, job runner), and uses them in low-noise steps to steal credentials and exfiltrate sensitive data. This leads to:

- High confidentiality loss  
- Moderate integrity damage (e.g., tampered training artifacts)  
- Temporary availability degradation (resource-heavy jobs)

## Impact

| Aspect          | Level  | Consequences |
|-----------------|--------|--------------|
| Confidentiality | High   | Sensitive data exposure |
| Integrity       | Medium | Potential tampering with system outputs |
| Availability    | Medium | Resource exhaustion or service delays |

---

## Detection
Defenders can monitor for:

- Unusual access to tool endpoints (repeated queries, abnormal IPs/geos)  
- Requests probing model or API capabilities or structured to elicit metadata  
- High-frequency, low-volume activity across multiple tools  
- Unexpected sequences of tool invocations  
- Anomalous outbound connections after tool usage  
- Authentication anomalies (stolen/unusual API keys, unauthorized manifest access)  

**Monitoring strategies:** centralize logging, correlate user/IP patterns, alert on high-volume or suspicious sequences, apply rate limiting and anomaly detection.

## Mitigation

1. **Configuration Hardening**  
   - Restrict tool manifests and metadata  
   - Disable verbose errors  
   - Sandbox tool execution  
   - Enforce allow-lists  

2. **Access Controls**  
   - Enforce MFA, short-lived API keys, RBAC  
   - Network segmentation  
   - Restrict admin/debug endpoints  

3. **Input Validation**  
   - Sanitize model inputs  
   - Validate tool parameters  
   - Reject suspicious sequences  

4. **Monitoring Requirements**  
   - Centralize logging  
   - Correlate events and alert on anomalies  
   - Enforce rate limits and quotas
